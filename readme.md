[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cedardevs/psi.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/cedardevs/psi)

The purpose of this project is to build a system which can both store and run processing workflows on the metadata
related to every file ingested and archived by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). 

## Development

### Requirements

1. Java
1. Docker
1. Docker Compose

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cedardevs/psi

docker containers with zookeeper, kafka, and each component.
