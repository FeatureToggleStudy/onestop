The Persistent Streaming Inventory is a distributed, scalable, event stream and database for the metadata associated
with environmental data granules. It is designed to receive metadata both from automated systems and manual uploads
of e.g. ISO-19115 XML metadata. It implements generic parsing and analysis of that metadata while also enabling arbitrary
processing flows on it. All metadata entities are retrievable via REST API and are also exposed as streaming events to
support downstream client applications for search, analysis, etc.

## Quickstart w/ Kubernetes + Helm

helm install ./helm/psi
