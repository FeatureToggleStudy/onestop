      file name: avro-1.8.2.jar (shaded: com.google.guava:guava:11.0.2)
      This vulnerability refers to an unbounded allocation that can occur during the deserialization of several specific
      classes provided by the Guava library. Howver, the only usage of Guava in this project is as a shaded dependency
      within the avro jar, and only the specific classes in use by avro have been shaded into it. Those shaded dependencies
      include neither AtomicDoubleArray nor CompoundOrdering_CustomFieldSerializer, the two classes containing the
      vulnerability (see the fix implemented later in Guava: https://github.com/google/guava/commit/7ec8718f1e6e2814dabaa4b9f96b6b33a813101c)
      In short, this vulnerability *as flagged due to avro-1.8.2.jar* is not present in this project.

      xzgrep command line tool. That script is not included in this jar, which is used to compress avro messages.

      Has to do with a flaw in default CORS filter configuration.
      Note that the default packaged war of this application does not contain
      this dependency as it is designed to be deployed to an existing servlet
