      Refers to a vulnerability in FasterXML jackson-databind which has been solved as of version 2.8.11.1.
      The latest version used is 2.9.3. The vulnerability is thus a false positive; further, the special conditions
      under which this vulnerability can be exposed is well-documented.

      file name: avro-1.8.2.jar (shaded: com.google.guava:guava:11.0.2)
      This vulnerability refers to an unbounded allocation that can occur during the deserialization of several specific
      classes provided by the Guava library. Howver, the only usage of Guava in this project is as a shaded dependency
      within the avro jar, and only the specific classes in use by avro have been shaded into it. Those shaded dependencies
      include neither AtomicDoubleArray nor CompoundOrdering_CustomFieldSerializer, the two classes containing the
      vulnerability (see the fix implemented later in Guava: https://github.com/google/guava/commit/7ec8718f1e6e2814dabaa4b9f96b6b33a813101c)

      In short, this vulnerability *as flagged due to avro-1.8.2.jar* is not present in this project.
