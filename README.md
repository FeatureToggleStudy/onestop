OneStop stack is used for publishing, discovery and access to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 
publicly available data. It is designed to receive metadata both from automated systems and manual uploads
of ISO-19115 XML metadata, it implements generic parsing and analysis of that metadata while also enabling arbitrary
processing flows on it and also all metadata entities are retrievable via REST API.

It is being developed on a grant by a team of researchers from the University of Colorado (more legal info below).
