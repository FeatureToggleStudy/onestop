## Deployment Documentation
In the deployment directory of the PSI project docs, details concerning infrastructure requirements and the project artifacts can be found. These documents are intended to get you familiar with the various elements of PSI -- their purpose, what is required to run them, and any important configuration details for individual components as well as for the servers PSI will run on.

Once PSI is up and running in your environment, head over to the [Usage](/docs/usage) docs for next steps.
